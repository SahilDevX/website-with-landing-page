As the mentor plans their time for these sessions prior cancellations before 3 hours of the scheduled start time are also considered for extension/pause. Under the extension, the session won't be counted as completed. This unattended session (by the mentee) would be conducted and adjusted by the mentor, in the upcoming time plan. The fees for this would not be included, or re-charged, if the reason is valid and stated 3 hours prior to the commencement of the session. Rather, the session's time would be adjusted. </p>
